## Code Katas

A collection of code katas from [CodeWars](https://codewards.com), broken down and structured by language and difficulty. As the saying goes, there's more than one way to skin a cat (no animals hurt during this sentence), and katas are a great way to see how other people tackle the same problem. There will certainly be much better solutions than the ones I present here. These are simply my attempts and I will be learning from the solutions others provide within the platform and not share those here.

8-kyu - Easiest
1-kyu - Hardest  

*Note: As each kata is required to pass the CodeWars suite of tests, no tests have been provided here, simply my final solution.*
